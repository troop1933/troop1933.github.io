								<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

								<p><i>Here are some questions you may have about our troop. Additional questions can be asked on our <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a>.</i></p>

								<p><i><b>1. What is the best way to get in touch with the Troop?</b></i><br />
								The best way to see what we are about is to visit a meeting, which we normally hold weekly. However, if you would like to talk directly to an adult leader, you can <a href="contact.html">provide contact information by clicking this link</a>.</p>

								<p><i><b>2. When does Troop 1933 normally meet?</b></i><br />
								Troop 1933 normally meets once per week. In the summer, these dates can vary depending on our summertime activities. During the school year, we meet on Tuesday nights. Meetings begin at 6:30 p.m., unless noted differently. Be sure to check <a href="https://twitter.com/troop1933" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a> for the most up-to-date information about our meetings and outings.</p>

								<p><b><i>3. What sort of activities do the scouts do?</i></b><br />
								The scouts in Troop 1933 do a variety of activities based upon their rank and what patrol they occupy. The core of our program revolves around learning skills, participating in community service, and doing outdoor activities. We stick to essential scouting skills like first aid, cooking, camping, physical fitness, and orienteering; however, different patrols might coordinate any number of diverse programs such as nature conservation, back country treks, or neighborhood volunteerism. A Boy Scout in our troop has the opportunity to decide their own interests and coordinate their efforts with other boys.</p>

								<p><b><i>4. Do you have to be religious to join?</i></b><br />
								Troop 1933 supports the Boy Scouts of America's <b><i>Declaration of Religious Principle</i></b>:
									<blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>The Boy Scouts of America maintains that no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without recognizing an obligation to God. In the first part of the Scout Oath or Promise the member declares, ‘‘On my honor I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law.’’ The recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgment of His favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members. No matter what the religious faith of the members may be, this fundamental need of good citizenship should be kept before them. The Boy Scouts of America, therefore, recognizes the religious element in the training of the member, but it is absolutely nonsectarian in its attitude toward that religious training. Its policy is that the home and the organization or group with which the member is connected shall give definite attention to religious life.</i></blockquote>
									</p>

								<p><b><i>5. How much does it cost to be in the Boy Scouts?</i></b><br />
								The cost of membership within our Troop is $5 per month, or $60 annually. This covers the requirements for national membership and insurance. In addition to this cost, each scout is required to supply their own uniform and personal gear. The troop owns all the necessary material required for basic outings, such as tents, stoves, and cooking gear. All outings that require an entrance fee must be covered by the scout or his family. The troop offers an annual fundraising activity (popcorn sales) in the autumn to allow a boy to pay his own way, and the troop will maintain an account for each boy to assist him with his financial obligations.</p>

								<p><b><i>6. Can I be in sports and still be a scout?</i></b><br />
								The benefits of Scouting are gained from active participation, and as such, the troop encourages its scouts to attend as many activities as possible. However, Troop 1933 also recognizes that other programs like scholastics, the arts, and sports also contribute to the development of skills and abilities necessary to a well-rounded individual. A boy can be engaged in scouting activities with his patrol and communicate his support for his fellow scouts while pursuing sports or any other extracurricular programs. Scouting has always been an opportunity to assist youth as they investigate a variety of interests.</p>
